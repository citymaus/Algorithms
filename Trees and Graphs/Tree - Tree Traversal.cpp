DEPTH-FIRST TRAVERSAL
Pre-order
1. Display the data part of root element (or current element)
2. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the pre-order function.
3. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the pre-order function.

In-order (symmetric)
1. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the in-order function.
2. Display the data part of root element (or current element).
3. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the in-order function.

Post-order
1. Traverse the left subtree by recursively calling the post-order function.
2. Traverse the right subtree by recursively calling the post-order function.
3. Display the data part of root element (or current element).
