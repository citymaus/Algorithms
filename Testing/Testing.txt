Interviewer: How would you test a pen?
Candidate: Let me find out a bit about the pen. Who is going to use the pen?
Interviewer: Probably children.
Candidate: Okay, that's interesting. What will they be doing with it? Will they be writing,
drawing, or doing something else with it?
Interviewer: Drawing.
Candidate: Ok, great. On what? Paper? Clothing? Walls?
Interviewer: On clothing.
Candidate: Great. What kind of tip does the pen have? Felt? Ball point? Is it intended to
wash off, or is it intended to be permanent?
Interviewer: It's intended to wash off.
Many questions later, you may get to this:

Candidate: Okay, so as I understand it, we have a pen that is being targeted at 5 to 10
year olds. The pen has a felt tip and comes in red, green, blue and black. It's intended to
wash off when clothing is washed. Is that correct?

• Fact check: Verify that the pen is felt tip and that the ink is one of the allowed colors.
• Intended use: Drawing. Does the pen write properly on clothing?
• Intended use: Washing. Does it wash off of clothing (even if it's been there for an
extended period of time)? Does it wash off in hot, warm and cold water?
• Safety: Is the pen safe (non-toxic) for children?
• Unintended uses: How else might children use the pen? They might write on other
surfaces, so you need to check whether the behavior there is correct. They might also
stomp on the pen, throw it, and so on. You'll need to make sure that the pen holds
up under these conditions.
