Could you replace the CPU cache with an SRAM? If you can what would be an advantage and disadvantage?

  Yes, we can replace. 

  Advantages: 
  1. More memory is available on SRAM when compared to cache. 
  2. Low cost of SRAM. 
  3. Probability of Instruction-HIT on SRAM is much higher than on Cache. 
  Disadvantages: 
  1. Latency in fetching instructions from SRAM is very high when compared to Cache. 
  2. Even if Large memory is present in SRAM the latency will turn out to be a bottle neck for the processor to execute instruction. 


  Thus using a Cache over SRAM and fetching instructions as a bulk from SRAM is more advantageous than directly accessing instructions from SRAM.

Difference between the stack and the heap?

  Physically stack and heap both are allocated on RAM and their implementation varies from language, compiler and run time 

  Stack is used for local variables of functions and to track function calling sequences. Heap is used for allocating dynamically created variables using malloc, calloc or new. 
  Stack memory is freed whenever the function completes execution but the heap memory needs to be freed explicitly using delete, free or by garbage collector of the language. 

  Stack memory of a process is fixed size and heap is variable memory. 

  Stack is faster than heap as allocating memory on stack is simpler just moving stack pointer up. 

  In case of multi threading, each thread of process will have a different stack but all threads share single heap

---------------------------------------------
Stack growing up or down?
  void checkStackGrowthDirection(){

	  int x = 10;
	  int y = 10;
	  int* oldStackBase = &x; 
	  int* newStackBase = &y;

	  ptrdiff_t offset = oldStackBase - newStackBase;

	  if (offset < 0 ){
		  cout << "Growing up" << endl;
	  }
	  else {
		  cout << "Growing down" << endl;
	  }
  }

-------------------------------------------
What is virtual memory ? What is the pre-requisite in hardware for supporting virtual memory ?

  The pre-requisite is that the CPU should have a memory management unit (MMU) to support virtual to physical address translation.

-------------------------------------------
How is endianness determined? OS or CPU architecture?

  Linux on PowerPC is big endian. The same on ARM. 
  On the PowerPC G4 a process could be little endian while a concurrent process was big endian. 
  A single bit in the status register of the CPU determined the current endianess.
