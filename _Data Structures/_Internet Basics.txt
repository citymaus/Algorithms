Socket types
-------------
Several Internet socket types are available:

Datagram sockets,               also known as connectionless sockets, which use User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
Stream sockets,                 also known as connection-oriented sockets, which use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).
Raw sockets (or Raw IP sockets), typically available in routers and other network equipment. Here the transport layer is bypassed, and the packet headers are made accessible to the application.
Other socket types are implemented over other transport protocols, such as Systems Network Architecture (SNA).[2] See also Unix domain sockets (UDS), for internal inter-process communication.
